  <h2> My inspirations </h2>
  <h3>Griselda Aragon</h3>
  <p> Growing up, I always looked up to my sister. There is a 12 year age gap between us,
    and I got to see her graduate high school and go on to college, having to manage being 
    a full time student and having a job. I saw how she struggled and how she still had time 
    to have a social life and take me out to eat or go to the movies. As a first-gen student, 
    she set the example for me and the rest of our family, that it is possible to break the barriers
    and go out, having a life of our own. She has always told me that even though she is doing good in life,
    I have to do better, I have to go on and do much more than she has. And that, is why I love my sister,
    she has been the one to push me when I couldn't even push myself, the one that I can talk to when I have nobody
    else to run to, the one to defend me when my mom is getting on my case. My sister, is one of my inspirations. </p>

  <h3> My mother</h3>
  <p> Mirian Aragon, my mom, is one of the strongest ladies I know, if not the strongest. She is the one to 
    who I owe my life to, the one who has given me everything that I could ever wish for.What has my mom not 
    done for me? She has pushed herself through her illnesses to be a loving mother, to be there for us both physically
    and mentally. From a moral standpoint, my mom taught me not to put up with anybody that doesn't value me for 
    what or who I am, she has taught me to be respectful to others even though some may not return that respect,I will not 
    be looked at as the rude girl that doesn't say good morning. Even though we may not have all the money in the world, I feel 
    rich to have a mother like mine. She may go in her moods where she bashes me for even breathing, but so do I, and I would not
    change that for anything in the world. Mama, la quiero mucho muchisimo:) </p>
