    <h1>Hi y'all, welcome to my page!!</h1>
    <h2> Who I am </h2>
    <p> My name is Diana Aragon and I’m a junior at Sharpstown International School in Houston, Texas. 
        I am a born and raised Houstonian!! GO STROS’!! I joined Code Chica as an effort to further my
        knowledge in HTML/CSS and get to know some wonderful ladies. I aspire to be a programmer after
        (hopefully) getting a BSCS major at UT Austin, and hope to build a home from the ground up. </p>

    <h2> Technology </h2>
    <p> I have used technology to learn and grow as a person, I have formed my own Girls Who Code club 
        at school and have gotten to know wonderful ladies from grades 6-11.I have also won the NCWIT AiC 
        Houston Affiliate Honorable Mention Award. I want to grow my circle of ladies in STEM even more!! </p>

    <h2> Extra curriculars </h2>
    <p> At school I am part of the Model UN secretariat!! I am the Undersecretary General of Conference,
        and am also a part of NHS, the National Honors Society. As previously mentioned I started my own
        Girls Who Code club at school (which I am incredibly proud of) with the help of my CompSci teacher, Mr. Nam. 
        I love to listen to music, go to concerts, watch netflix, travel, and play the guitar. </p>
